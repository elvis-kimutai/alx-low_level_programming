# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
Bitwise AND (&): This operator compares the corresponding bits of two operands and sets the bit to 1 if both bits are 1.

Bitwise OR (|): This operator compares the corresponding bits of two operands and sets the bit to 1 if either of the bits is 1.

Bitwise XOR (^): This operator compares the corresponding bits of two operands and sets the bit to 1 if the bits are different.

Bitwise NOT (~): This operator flips all the bits in an operand (i.e., it changes 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).

Left shift (<<): This operator shifts the bits of an operand to the left by a specified number of bits.

Right shift (>>): This operator shifts the bits of an operand to the right by a specified number of bits.
